<h1>About tilswiki<br></h1>The intention of tilswiki is to make it <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 170, 0);">as easy as possible</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 170, 0);">quickly create a publicly accessible page</span> to share some information with others. For example a page comparing some available used cars asking your friends for advice. Or a page coordinating your birthday party.<br><br><h2>How to use it<br></h2>Just create a new page with the desired title, e.g. 'My birthday party', click into the text and then start typing.<br><br>To format the text and to add images or other elements, use the buttons in the panel on the right.<br><br>Everything you do will be saved within a couple of seconds automatically.<br><br>When you want to share your page with others, copy the URL that is shown in your browsers address bar (something like <span style="font-style: italic;">http://tils.net:4000/my-birthday-party</span>) and mail it around or publish it.<br><h2>What it does not and never will do<br></h2>Require any kind of login. If you want to make a private page, then give it a title that cannot be guessed.<br><br>Feature XYZ. This is highly opinionated software motivated by my personal needs and my desire to play with and better learn some awesome technologies (notable <span style="font-weight: bold;">jquery</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">javascript</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">merb</span>).<br><br><h2>What it should do <small><small>(but doesn't)</small></small><br></h2>When you insert a URL into the text, it should look what the URL points to and do something that makes sense, e.g. embed the image, or link to the page etc.<br><br>Image resizing, dragging and positioning.<br><br>Allow to insert youtube and other video URLs and play them on the page.<br><br>Allow to insert google maps URLs and show the map in the page.<br><br>Maybe it should allow to lock pages so that they can only be edited by specific people.<br><br>Maybe it should show a history of edits and allow to revert to previous versions.<br><h2>Problems</h2>Currently <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 17, 17);">only works on Firefox 3</span>. It should be able to make it work on IE as well, but that hasn't been done yet.<br><br>The editing behaviour is very dependent on the browser implementation and may be a little awkward, e.g. a bold formatting may be carried in surprising ways etc. When in doubt, delete the troublesome text and re-type or paste it.<br><br>There is not much that can be done to influence the html that the browser generates I'm afraid.<br><br>
